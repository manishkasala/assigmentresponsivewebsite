               <h1>AVENGERS</h1>
               <p>Last summer Marvel’s The Avengers was such a big hit within audiences of all ages because of the common love for super hero stories. This movie in particular was extremely successful because of its unique story that we have not seen in theatres before. This story is not just about one or two superheroes, but a whole team of superheroes coming together to fight a greater evil. The very entertaining story that is “The Avengers” comes from the original comic book series “Marvel’s The Avengers: Earth’s Mightiest Super-Heroes”. What may surprise people is that The Avengers movie is much more than just a simple remake of the traditional comic books.

                The first and probably most noticeable difference is the group of heroes that make up the Avengers. In the movie the group consists of Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Black Widow were all assembled at the same time. In the original comic book series, the group includes Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Ant Man, Wasp, and in a few issues later, Captain America and Hawkeye were added to the team as well. Also in the comics, as time goes on the group loses and gains a variety of members, including the Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Beast, Wonder Man, Falcon, Ms. Marvel, Wolverine, She-Hulk, Storm, Spider-Man, Luke Cage, and a many more who were not pictured in the film.
                
                The second but most influential difference would be the story of how the team actually came together. The original story is that Loki who is angered by his imprisonment to the Isle of Silence and seeks revenge on his step-brother, Thor, for being responsible. He uses his mental abilities to trick the Hulk into destroying a train trestle with the illusion that dynamite has been placed on the tracks. As a train approaches Hulk realizes that with the track down the train will crash for sure, so standing on a massive boulder he holds the track on his shoulders allowing the train to pass over the crevasse. The conductor sees no dynamite and only notices the broken track and Hulk standing below it, which leads him to believe that Hulk is rampaging again, and trying to destroy the train.
                
                As the manhunt for Hulk begins, Loki uses his powers to prevent the Fantastic Four from hearing the call to assist in locating the Hulk and instead tries to force the signal to reach only Dr. Don Blake (the human persona of Thor). While initially the signal does not reach the Fantastic Four, it does reach Thor, Iron Man, Ant-Man, and Wasp. After the battle and after defeating Loki, the five heroes decide to team-up and then start The Avengers. In the movie they are simply just brought together by Nick Fury, who is the head of S.H.I.EL.D., to try and stop Loki.
                
                The third significant difference from the comic to the movies is that in the movie Hawkeye is the character that Loki uses mind control in an attempt to get him to fight against the Avengers. Because Black Widow and Hawkeye were some what romantically involved in the movie she was the one who was able to get him out of Loki’s mind control and convert him back to the Avengers. In the comic book, Black Widow is the one who is brain washed to fight against the team but in the comic she is a only a member of S.H.I.E.L.D., while Wasp is the only female character on the team.
                
                Even though there were some differences from the comic to the movie the setting was still in New York City and the team was always in contact with S.H.I.E.L.D. They also were both assembled from a group effort to fight against Thor’s brother Loki and from that moment on stayed together as The Avengers to fight the world’s greater evils. That having been said, the amount of changes made to the storyline to accommodate the movie allow it to separate from that comic book realm and become its own cinematic entity.
                
                Another way that the The Avengers film is truly a text separate from The Avengers comic books just from the numerous paratexts the film has created. The ten films The Avengers has spawn along with the multiple TV shows, comics, toy lines, trailers, merchandise, video games, and books are all built around the 2012 film and not the comic. The five paratextual films that set the stage for 2012s The Avengers is something that has never been attempted before on such a large scale in film. Dating back to 2008s Ironman, Marvel kicked off “the Avengers initiative” by introducing the character Nick Fury and Agent Coulson, two agents looking to create a superhero team. Just by the introduction of these characters the possibility of a great Marvel universe in film was created.
                
                Over the next four years Marvel intertwine the stories and characters of The Avengers through after-credit scenes, minor rolls, and viral marketing for the films, The Incredible Hulk, Ironman 2, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger. With Captain America’s 2011 release, the stage was set for The Avengers in 2012. Because each of these origin films closely followed the story of their textual predecessor, back-stories for characters like Ironman and Captain America were established. With these back-stories Marvel was able to create a new Avenger team with different characters, locations, and events.</p>
